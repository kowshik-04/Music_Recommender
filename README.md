# Music Recommender System

## Introduction
This repository contains code for building a music recommender system using collaborative filtering techniques, particularly focusing on the k-nearest neighbors (kNN) algorithm. A recommender system helps predict what songs a user might enjoy based on their interactions with other songs.

## Types of Recommender Systems
There are primarily two types of recommender systems:

1. **Content-based filters**: Predicts user preferences based on the features of items they have liked in the past.
2. **Collaborative filters**: Predicts user preferences based on the preferences of similar users.

This project focuses on collaborative filtering.

## Collaborative Filtering
Collaborative filters work with an interaction matrix, aiming to learn a function that predicts whether a user will benefit from an item based on past interactions.

Two main types of collaborative filters:
- **User-item filtering**: Recommends items to a user based on what similar users have liked.
- **Item-item filtering**: Recommends items similar to those a user has liked in the past.

## Algorithms Used
Several machine learning algorithms can be applied in collaborative filtering:
- Nearest Neighbor
- Clustering
- Matrix Factorization

Here, we'll utilize the k-nearest neighbors (kNN) algorithm.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- FuzzyWuzzy
- scikit-learn

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kowshik-04/Music_Recommender.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage
1. Import necessary libraries.
2. Initialize the `Recommender` class with appropriate parameters (`metric`, `algorithm`, `k`, `data`, `decode_id_song`).
3. Call the `make_recommendation` method with a new song and the number of recommendations desired.

## Example
```python
from recommender import Recommender

# Initialize recommender
recommender = Recommender(metric='cosine', algorithm='brute', k=5, data=data, decode_id_song=decode_id_song)

# Get recommendations
recommendations = recommender.make_recommendation(new_song='Shape of You', n_recommendations=10)
print(recommendations)
```
